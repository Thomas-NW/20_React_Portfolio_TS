## Contributing
👪 Thank you for research information on the WWW for React, great Bootstrap resources, such as from Brandon Larson, BootstrapCreative, get bootstrap.com, startbootstrap.com, and others.
Moreover, I would like to thank Tom McCarthy for his support and guidance for the conversion to React.
The folder structure was taken from an activity of the Bootcamp activity resources. If I would rewrite this portfolio, I would structure the files differently!
